## After a long time putting it off, I finally launched my own website.

Here I want to share articles and thoughts about technology, lifestyle and visions of what happens in the daily life of a programmer, expatriate and with an innovative mind.

I hope with time to transmit a little of what I have learned over the last 12 years, living in different countries, living with different cultures and learning different fields of technology in general.

Welcome and I hope soon to start sharing some series of posts about the subjects I read on a daily basis.
