I'm a frontend developer based in Copenhagen passionate about UX design. I have been building websites for almost five years and have always been excited about making pixel-perfect apps, however I rarely had the opportunity to share my ideas and contribute to the design process as a software engineer.

I would love to change that and step closer into the world of UX/UI! Having a computer science background, I can easily identify the technical limitations when prototyping a solution and come up with feasible designs. Constantly improving user interfaces is the thing I find most rewarding in the web development world.
